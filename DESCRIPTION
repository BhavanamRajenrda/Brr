Description: The "AtConP" Attribute Convertion package was
    created to minimize the repetition of some task which
    include converting character to factor attributes and
    creating dummy variables. This package includes three function
    initially, df.factor, df.matrix and df.AVF. The function df.factor takes
    the argument of a dataframe and find for any character attributes
    and if it match the attributes is then converted to class factor, the
    output of the function "df.factor" is a data frame and can be store
    in a new data frame. The other function "df.matrix" takes the "x" (data frame)
    as argument and an option argument "name","Sep" which is to specify the intial
    name of the dummy data frame and factor column and level seperated by "sep", after providing the argument the function
    "df.matrix" search for the class factor in the given data frame(x) and
    if it match it store the attribute name and count the number of factor
    levels, the function then create a data frame with name provided by the user
    and adding that name by ":" with the attribute name store by the function, and
    thens columns as per the number of levels (which is number of levels n - 1).
    The next step it store the values of each column as 0 and 1 for building a model. The function df.AVF takes the data frame
    as argument and search for a factor column, then create a data frame of only factor column and compute the attribute
    value frequency score.
